        <h2>Uncovering Symmetric and Asymmetric Deterioration Patterns in Maryland’s Steel Bridges Through Time-Series Clustering and PCA - 2025</h2>

        <p class="project-subtitle">
          Peer-Reviewed Journal Publication | Symmetry (2025)
        </p>

        <p>
          This study investigates long-term deterioration behavior in 1,378 Maryland steel bridges
          using Bridge Health Index (BHI) time-series data from 1995–2021.
        </p>

        <p>
          By integrating K-means time-series clustering, bootstrap uncertainty analysis,
          and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the research identifies six distinct
          deterioration archetypes and quantifies symmetric versus asymmetric
          structural degradation patterns across the statewide bridge network.
        </p>

        <p>
          The findings reveal how traffic demand, span length, deck geometry,
          and rehabilitation history influence long-term structural performance.
          The framework provides a scalable, data-driven approach to support
          predictive asset management, inspection prioritization,
          and proactive infrastructure planning.

        <h2>Integrating Machine Learning Techniques for Enhanced Safety and Crime Analysis in Maryland - 2025</h2>

        <p class="project-subtitle">
          Peer-Reviewed Journal Publication | Applied Sciences (2025)
        </p>

        <p>
          This study develops a comprehensive machine learning framework to analyze and predict
          crime trends across Maryland’s urban, suburban, and rural counties using multi-year
          crime and socio-economic datasets.
        </p>

        <p>
          By integrating Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Extra Trees, and advanced
          ensemble stacking models, the research identifies localized crime patterns,
          demographic influences, and temporal trends. The framework incorporates spatial
          and temporal analysis, feature engineering, and cross-validation to improve
          predictive accuracy and interpretability.
        </p>

        <p>
          The results demonstrate how AI-driven predictive modeling can support data-informed
          policing strategies, hotspot detection, resource allocation, and equitable public
          safety planning across diverse regional contexts.

          Peer-Reviewed Conference Publication | Associated Schools of Construction (ASC) (2024)
        </p>

        <p>
          This study analyzes construction fatality reports from the NIOSH FACE program using text mining,
          statistical modeling, and network analysis to uncover patterns in accident causation.
          By transforming unstructured incident narratives into structured datasets,
          the research identifies dominant contributing factors, emerging safety trends,
          and relationships between root causes and recommended interventions.
          The framework demonstrates how AI-driven analytics can support proactive safety planning,
          targeted training programs, and data-informed decision-making in construction risk management.

        <h2>Exploring U.S. Occupant Perception Toward Indoor Air Quality Via Social Media and NLP Analysis - 2024</h2>
        <p class="project-subtitle">
          Peer-Reviewed Journal Publication | Journal of Environmental Science and Public Health (2024)
        </p>

        <p>
          This nationwide study investigates U.S. occupant perception of indoor air quality (IAQ)
          during COVID-19 stay-at-home periods using geo-tagged social media data and
          Natural Language Processing (NLP). Using time-series sentiment analysis and emotion modeling in R, we analyzed over
          45,000 tweets from 2019–2020 to evaluate shifts in public perception toward IAQ.
          The findings revealed increased negative sentiment during 2020,
          highlighting how prolonged indoor exposure influenced occupant dissatisfaction
          and building health awareness. The research demonstrates how AI-driven linguistic analysis can extract
          large-scale human insight to inform sustainable building design,
          ventilation strategies, and indoor environmental policy.

        <h2>IntegrativeSentiment.io (iS.io) - 2022</h2>
        <p class="project-subtitle">
          A web-based interactive tool for integrated human sentiment modeling
        </p>

        <p>
          iS.io is an interactive platform for analyzing large volumes of human feedback, such as
          social media text through real-time sentiment modeling. It combines NLP methods with
          emotion-oriented frameworks to translate raw text into interpretable indicators of sentiment.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tool streamlines the full workflow (data collection, cleaning, tokenization, and modeling),
          so users can run analyses without needing to write code. It also supports network-style
          visualizations and map-based views to help users explore patterns across space and time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Built in R and delivered through the URBiiLAB web portal, iS.io provides a browser-based
          experience that does not require working directly in RStudio.
